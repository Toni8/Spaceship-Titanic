# Spaceship-Titanic
Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension
This project is part of a competition where the goal is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly. The competition provides a dataset of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system, which will be used to build a predictive model.

Dataset Description
Files
train.csv: Personal records for approximately two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers. This file is used as training data for the model.
test.csv: Personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers. This file is used to generate predictions for the competition.
sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file in the correct format for submission to the competition.
Data Fields
PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger. The ID is in the format gggg_pp, where gggg represents the group the passenger is traveling with, and pp is their number within the group. Groups often consist of family members but not always.
HomePlanet: The planet from which the passenger departed, typically their planet of permanent residence.
CryoSleep: Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation (CryoSleep) for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in CryoSleep are confined to their cabins.
Cabin: The cabin number where the passenger is staying. The format is deck/num/side, where side can be either P (Port) or S (Starboard).
Destination: The planet where the passenger is scheduled to debark.
Age: The age of the passenger.
VIP: Indicates whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck: The amounts billed by the passenger at each of the Spaceship Titanic's various luxury amenities.
Name: The first and last names of the passenger.
Transported: The target variable. Indicates whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the column that the model aims to predict.
Submission Format
The submission file should be in the following format:

PassengerId: The unique identifier for each passenger in the test set.
Transported: The predicted value for whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. For each passenger, predict either True or False.
How to Use
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset.
Model Building: Train a predictive model using the provided training data.
Prediction: Generate predictions on the test data.
Submission: Format the predictions in the required submission format and submit them to the competition.
